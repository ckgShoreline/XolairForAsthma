        <h3>Asthma</h3>
        <p>Asthma causes airways to narrow and swell as well as produce excess mucus. This causes symptoms such as coughing, difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, and inflammed bronchi in the lungs. Cases of asthma range from mild to severe (life threatening). The root cause of asthma is currently unknown. It may be genetic since it tends to run in families and it can be triggered or exasperated by environment (allergens pollen dust mold pet dander) physical activity cold air smoke stress  Asthma cannot be cured but it can be treated with a variety of medications.</a></p>
        <p>During an asthma attack the immune system perceives an antigen and produces IgE (immunoglobulin E) in response. This immunoglobulin is associated with allergies and asthma. It binds to white blood cells causing them to release histamine which triggers the symptoms of an asthma attack.</a></p>
        <p>There are both long term treatments designed to keep asthma under control and reduce the chances of having an asthma attack as well as short term immediate relief treatments designed to relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. Inhaled corticosteroids are a common long term treatment for asthma. They have low risk of serious side effects. Leukotriene modifiers are another option. These are oral medications. Short acting beta agonists inhalers and anticholinergic agents are used for relief during an asthma attack. These medications relax the airways making it easier to breathe. Allergy medications can also be used to treat asthma, in particular asthma that is triggered by environmental factors.</p></p>
