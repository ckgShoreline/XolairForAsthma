            <p>A mouse monoclonal antibody that can specifically target the IgE molecule was used to make the gene. This gene was humanized by replacing specific amino acids in human IgG1 with those from the mouse antibody. The resulting humanized antibody had a high affinity of IgE but would not bind to the cell-IgE complex creating a histamine release and allergic reaction. This gene was added to a plasmid and transfected into cells using electroporation.<br>CHO cells are used to produce Xolair. They are grown in suspension culture. The nutrient media used includes the antibiotic gentamicin to reduce the risk of contamination.<br><br>BiosanaPharma is creating a biosimilar to Xolair with the same API (Omalizumab) using fully continuous biomanufaturing to increase yield and lower upstream costs.</p>

              <p>Downstream purification of Xolair includes both chromatography and filtration. Immobilized protein A column chromatography, cation exchange chromatography (on SP sepharose), and anion exchange chromatography (on Q sepharose) are used sequentially to purify the antibody. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration are then used to concentrate the antibodies.</p>

      <p>The Code of Federal Regulations outlines procedures for biologics that pertain to personnel, equipment, methods, and testing. One important regulation is sterilizing equipment so that the biologic does not become contaminated with microbes. CFR title 21 Subpart B establishment standards Sec 600.11 Physical establishment, equipment, animals, and care states that <em>The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure shall be no less than that achieved by an attained temperature of 121.5 deg.C maintained for 20 minutes by saturated steam or by an attained temperature of 170 deg.C maintained for 2 hours with dry heat.</em> This regulation is important since it ensures that all equipment used in the manufacturing of the biologic is properly sterilized. If a manufacturer was to not follow this guideline they run the risk that the equipment still has traces of microbial contamination.</p>
