      <h3>Biologic Characteristics</h3>
      <p>The active biologic in Xolair is the monoclonal antibody IgG1 (Omalizumab). This antibody specifically targets and binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the body preventing IgE from reaching receptors. By preventing IgE from reaching the receptors Xolair inhibits the production of histamine by the body which causes the symptoms of asthma.</p>
      <h3>Risks</h3>
      <p>The most serious risk associated with Xolair is anaphylaxis which can be life threatening. Anaphylaxis has been reported to occur after administration of Xolair in clinical trials. anaphylaxis was reported in 3 of 3507 (0.1%) patients with asthma who received the medication. Anaphylaxis occurred with the first dose in two patients and with the fourth dose in one patient. It occured 90 minutes after administration in two patients and 2 hours after administration in one patient. Even though this reation is rare, due to the severity of it Xolair is administered in a clinical setting where patients are monitered. Only after approval from a health care professional can patients begin to self administer at home. Patients who have experienced anaphylaxis or other serious allergic reations before have a higher risk of getting anaphylaxis from Xolair.<br><a class="link" href="https://www.xolairhcp.com/allergic-asthma.html">Read all risks associated with Xolair</a><br><br>In 2014 the FDA completed a long term study of Xolair. The study found that long term use of Xolair can lead to increased risk of heart, brain, and blood vessel problems. All of these problems are stem from blood clots in the body. The discovery of this risk demonstrates the importance of pharmacovigilance and continued testing even after a product is approved by the FDA. Even with this newfound risk Xolair remains an available medication for many people with asthma.<br><a class="link" href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-approves-label-changes-asthma-drug-xolair-omalizumab-including">Read the FDA announcement</a></p>
